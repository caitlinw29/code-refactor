# code-refactor
This web page is my homework assignment focused on code refactoring. I improved the search engine optimization of the page by including semantic HTML elements, providing alt tags for images, and providing a clear title. 

The code was also refactored to include detailed comments, and the CSS selectors were consolidated.
